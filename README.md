# EOSQuest
This is a project that can package for Oculus Quest 2 in arm64 that can provide basic peer-to-peer connections using the EOSCore plugin. It is setup by default to login using Device IDs. It is also worth mentioning that although sessions can be created and connected to, this project does NOT include any player replication. As long as the session can be created and connected to, then you know you're basic peer-to-peer connections are working.

NOTE: This project does NOT come with the EOSCore plugin. You can purchase here on the Unreal Engine Marketplace: https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/af157f773f084ca89036cd7bc03fb416?sessionInvalidated=true)
